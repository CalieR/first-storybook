# First Storybook

First attempt at using Storybook to build out some React components with tests

## Steps

1. Setup

- Create a component folder in src. Create a new folder in here for each component
- Change config.js to get the stories files from components folder (instead of the automatically created stories folder)

1. Image component:

- It should render an image, given a path
- Create an Image component - needs at least a url and title attribute
- Specify proptypes
- Create accompanying story file with default story
- Add testing with Storyshots and Jest
- Select useful addons
